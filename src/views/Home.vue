    <h1>Productivity</h1>
    <p>
      I created this site to document my productivity tools and share about what methods I use to stay productive. I am
      by no means a productivity expert nor are these methods scientifically proven, these methods work for me
      personally so I thought I'd share them so others might be able to learn from it! While I do not believe in
      hyper-optimising my day, I do believe in staying productive. This means that while I do not overbook and aim to
      cram a PhD in a day, I still try to maximise my time spent by properly organising my day. This allows me to remain
      on task and keeps me entertained. It also allows me learn as much as I can while providing enough breathing room
      to avoid burnout.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been applying these techniques for varying durations ever since 2015 and I have discovered that some
      techniques in particular work especially well for me.
