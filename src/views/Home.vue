    <h1>Productivity</h1>
    <p>
      I created this site to document my productivity tools and share about what methods I use to stay productive. I am
      by no means a productivity expert nor are these methods scientifically proven, these methods work for me
      personally so I thought I'd share them so others might be able to learn from it!
    </p>

    <p>
      I have been applying these techniques for varying durations ever since 2015 and I have discovered that some
      techniques in particular work especially well for me.
